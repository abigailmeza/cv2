        <p class="intro-text">I am currently an undergraduate student studying computer
          science at the University of British Columbia. I love drinking coffee

          <h3>Design & Development</h3>
          <p>
            I learned how to code during my freshman year in university while
            taking an introductory computer science course as an elective.
            I enjoyed it so much that it wasn't much of a surprise when I
            decided to transfer into computer science the following year.
            <!-- Especially since I've always loved computers and video games as a
            child and in high school, I had discovered a liking for graphic design. -->

          <p>But my best skill is actually in eating eggs. I once ate a dozen
            eggs worth of scrambled eggs in one sitting.</p>
